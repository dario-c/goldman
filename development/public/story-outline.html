                <h2>1. RUSSIA</h2>
                <p>The film opens with Paul describing 40th birthday. He is living in California, 
                    <br> working a boring desk job, alone and without much of a social life. He receives 
                <br>
                a catalog for a Russian Brides matchmaking service, and though he scoffs at first, 
                <br>
                it piques his interest. As he tells the story, we cut to re-enactment clips of the  
                <br>scenes as he described them later in his book and screenplay. Paul plays himself 
                <br> and actors play the other characters.</p>
                
                <p>We flash forward a few months: Paul is on a plane to Moscow to meet Svetlana,
                    <br>
                a woman he has been in contact with. In this opening sequence — through
                <br>
                 interviews, book excerpts read by Paul, and reenactments, we get a sense of his
                <br>
                 personality. He is exuberant, a man of extremes. Once he has set his sites on
                <br>
                 something, he cannot be stopped. He many also be a tad short-sighted and naïve
                <br>
                 in his pursuits. He heads to Russia convinced he will return with a loving bride —
                <br>
                 and will finally be whole. Although the trip goes well at first, he gets a hint that
                <br>
                 Svetlana’s motives may be suspect and it sours him on the whole relationship,
                <br>
                 instantly. Again — a man of extremes. He returns to the agency, which sets him 
                <br>
                up with the more modest Talia. They hit it off.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>2. MARRIAGE TO TALIA</h2>

                <p>She returns to America and they wed and have a son. For the second time,
                <br>
                he feels secure in his bliss, the perfect life with the perfect family. But the 
                <br>
                complications of people and relationships can only be swept aside for so long.
                <br>
                 Talia grows distant and spends all of her time studying for medical school. Their
                <br>
                 union dissolves and Paul is left with Johnny, his son. His new mission is clear
                <br>

                (in his words): He must find a “mommy” for Johnny. Paul’s ever-heightening goal
                <br>

                — the thing that once he achieves, all will be well — is what propels the film
                <br>

                and continues to evolve as circumstances change.</p>

                <h2>3. COURTSHIP OF AUDREY</h2>
                
                <p>Florida: A few years later. Paul is living in Florida with Johnny. He has bought a
                <br> home-painting business and runs it with his new best friend, Daniel. Paul meets
                <br> Audrey, a woman he met on a Jewish singles site. He is ever-determined to skip
                <br> past dating and establish his family, thinking things will finally be fine. Despite a
                <br> series of red flags, Paul proposes to Audrey a few months after they meet, having
                <br> only seen her a small handful of times. He is set in his vision of how his life will
                <br> go and again is making attempts to conform his reality to that vision. She is at this
                <br> point already exhibiting extremely bizarre behaviors — always on her phone and 
                <br>hanging up abruptly when Paul enters the room, preoccupied with getting her
                <br> name on his assets, prone to rage, and so on. They have an extremely awkward
                <br> and memorable sexual encounter the night he proposes.</p>

                <h2>4. MARRIAGE & SEPARATIONS</h2>
                
                <p>The time before and around the wedding is marked but turbulence. They almost
                <br> break up over sharing assets and there is a period of months in which they do not
                <br> speak. But Paul is determined to make it to the wedding — in hindsight, doing
                <br> much of Audrey’s con work for her. During the time, she only spends a few days a
                <br> week with Paul, telling him that she spends the rest of her time looking after her
                <br> sick grandmother a few hours away. They marry and he is in a temporary bliss —
                <br> has he finally achieved what he’s looking for? It is short-lived.</p>

                <p>She begins acting strange. She vanishes for most of a New Years’ eve. She tells
                <br>
                him his sex drive is abnormal and they attempt to set an acceptable schedule
                <br>
                for sex. As Paul digs deeper, the insane becomes the mundane. But things
                <br> continue to get worse. His friend and business partner, Daniel, disappears with
                <br>
                all of the money from their business. As a condition for returning from one of
                <br> their separations, Audrey asks Paul to send checks to an address to cover her
                <br> health insurance. Suspicious, he goes to the address – this is the first example
                <br>
                of Paul in “investigative” mode — and discovers it to be a trailer park, containing
                <br> a trailer she secretly owns.</p>

                <p>He confronts her and they split.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="segment bar outline post-marriage">
                <h2>5. POST-MARRIAGE: THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH</h2>

                <p>Looking for answers, Paul sees a pet psychic named Terry. She sets 
                    <br>
                him on a mission to dig into Audrey’s past.</p>

                <p>This section of the film is an avalanche of revelations. As Paul digs through 
                    <br>
                bank statements, hacked emails, even garbage bags — he pieces together Audrey’s  
                <br>secret double life as a con artist, madam,  and prostitute of a multi-state call girl 
                <br> ring. She seems to be in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend and pimp, 
                <br>
                a man Paul calls “Royce Rocco”. He hires PIs to tail her and finds her picking up  
                <br>tricks and meeting her girls.</p>

                <p>He approaches law enforcement: Cops. FBI. The press. When no one responds, 
                    <br>
                he becomes convinced of potential corruption in the department. As Paul digs 
                <br> deeper, he is in this section evolving the vision of himself from “Dad” / family 
                <br>
                man to a crime fighting crusader.</p>

                <p>In this section we also investigate Paul’s decision to begin compiling his story 
                    <br>
                into a book, and even potentially a film. As he is on his mission, he is also 
                <br> obsessively documenting it and planning for a future in which he gets to tell 
                <br>
                his story to the world.</p>

                <h2>6. THE INTERNET</h2>
                <p>Paul writes a book called “Duplicity: A True Story of Crime And Deceit”. He  <br>self-publishes it on Amazon. He produces videos and a newsletter called “The  <br>Warrior”, in which he seeks to help other victimized people in relationships  <br>empower themselves. This is the fight sign of Paul acting for the benefit of others <br> in what may or may not be an attempt to promote himself and his story. He starts <br> a twitter account and tweets endlessly. He also writes a screenplay version of the <br> story (from which we have earlier depicted scenes), hoping that it can become a <br> blockbuster. He tweets at people who work in Entertainment.</p>

                <p>We show a scene from the end of his screenplay: Audrey and Royce are laughing <br> about Paul when they are suddenly murdered by higher-ups in the mob.</p>

                <p>In an interview, Paul admits that this did not happen, and perhaps why he felt it  <br>necessary to include. This takes us to:</p>

            <div class="segment outline chronicles">

                <h2>7. THE CHRONICLES, VINDICATION AND BEYOND</h2>
                
                <p>Paul had attempted for years to make his story national news. But no one 
                    <br> listened, and no one really cared. So he decided to change tack. He pulled down 
                    <br> the website and deleted his tweets. He released a video on YouTube as a new 
                    <br> character — Ryan Sinclair, a fan of Paul Goldman’s. He writes “The Paul T Goldman 
                <br> Chronicles”, a series of e-books self-published on Amazon in which he tells the 
                <br> further adventures of Paul T Goldman, now running around Europe trying to break 
                <br> up international sex trafficking rings.</p>

                <p>We begin to show pivotal scenes from the Chronicles. Paul and Johnny are 
                    <br> kidnapped after Audrey’s funeral. They are freed by a mysterious man who
                    <br> 
                sets Paul on his mission. We will depict a few action scenes — gripping, 
                <br> edge-of-your-seat action scenes made all the more compelling by the fact that
                <br> 
                we know the author is a man writing heroic “fan-fic” about his own life. This 
                <br> culminates in a scene where Paul has crash-landed in Moscow and seeks refuge
                <br>  with Svetlana — the real woman who rejected him many years ago. In this world, 
                <br> they kiss in the rain and she tells him she always loved him. He is writing himself 
                <br> the perfect closure for the events in his life he could not control. We will intercut 
                 <br> these action scenes with documentary footage and depict out the reality
                 <br> 
                of his day-to-day life.</p>

                <p>He promotes these books through the website StopChildSexTrafficking.org — <br>
                a topic that has very little to do with his original intention of revenge on his ex. <br> He tweets hundreds of times a day and counts among his “allies” celebrities <br>
                that have spoken out against sex trafficking.</p>

                <p>As Paul went deeper into this new mission, his plans expanded. Sequels became  <br>more and more outlandish. There would be a series of kid detective stories called “The Johnny Goldman Chronicles”. There would even be a cartoon starring their <br> dog. And the question arises — what is now driving Paul T Goldman? The desire <br> for justice and to strike down sex trafficking? Or does he just want to be famous?</p>

                <p>The climax of the film intercuts dramatizes scenes from his “Paul T Goldman  <br> Chronicles” with his more mundane real life, and increasingly heightened (and  <br> more and more successful) quest to be heard. We show more and more “behind <br>  the scenes” of Paul orchestrating the cinematic telling of his story and examine <br>  not only the blurring lines between fantasy and reality, but whether or not that  <br> distinction really even matters anymore.</p>

                <p>Has he found what he’s looking for? Can he ever?</p>

                <p>By the film’s end, the viewer’s act of watching it, in providing an audience for <br>  Paul, has actually become part of his story. Paul has gone from being a silly man, <br>  to a perhaps crazy man — to something much richer: A product of the modern age  <br> who has come to look at an unfortunate situation in his life as an “in” to being heard/validated/famous… <span class="highlight">and it’s working.</span></p>
