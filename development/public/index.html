            <h2>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>A few years ago, a man identifying himself as Paul T. Goldman tweeted at me: My story is amazing. You should make a movie out of it. I looked at his Twitter and, unsurprisingly, he had said the same exact thing to hundreds of people. But I looked at Paul’s site — I watched his videos, read his blog, and bought his book Duplicity: A True Story of Crime and Deceit. I found it to be one of the most fascinating things I’ve ever read. Paul is, at different times, funny, heartbreaking, maddening, questionable, admirable — he is everything. He’s one of the most compelling people I’ve ever met. He is extreme and bizarre and yet at the same time, he taps into deeply human, vulnerable, universal qualities that I see in myself and everyone I know.</p>
            <p>In the years since I’ve started following his story, it has only grown exponentially more interesting. My passion for his story — and it is the story of both the actual events in his life and the story of how he has devoted himself to promoting the story of what he wishes his life to be — has only deepened.</p>
            <p>I envy the general public, because they have not yet had the joy of discovering Paul T. Goldman.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="approach">
            <h2>APPROACH</h2>
           
            <p>The type of film that this will be has been evolving from day one. At first, it seemed the sensible thing to do would be to option Paul’s book and life, and then write, cast, and shoot a feature about a regular, slightly goofy guy who walks into a bad situation and his attempts to “take down the ring” that wronged him. But the more time I spent talking to Paul, the more I realized that Paul himself is the story. He is what makes this unlike any story I’ve ever seen on film. As such, I intend to shoot a film in which Paul can express his story in the purest way possible. We’ve spent many hours interviewing Paul on camera and for the second phase, we will set about re-creating the pivotal events of his story. This includes both the actual events of the book and some of the action-packed scenes that he wrote — or may have had ghost-written — for his Paul T Goldman Chronicles series. I want to treat his material with maximum seriousness – cast good actors alongside him to play his versions of the people in his life, aim for the highest production value we can afford – and actualize the movie of his life that he sees in his head. In some ways, elements of the project evoke a comedic “Act of Killing”. There are also shades of “Stories We Tell” and the off-kilter protagonists of “Grizzly Man” and Errol Morris films. By the end of the movie, we will have watched the transformation of this self-proclaimed “regular guy” into the hero he sees himself to be. We will make real the world he has imagined for himself and in doing so, examine the role of narrative in all of our lives, and the hope and purpose it can provide. We will also call into question the motives that keep him on his daily mission.</p>

            <p>The finished film will be a mix of interviews, documentary footage, re-created scenes written by Paul (both fictional and non-fictional), and behind-the-scenes footage of Paul reconstructing his story for the silver screen. Although pure objectivity is impossible, we will make it our mission to let what is funny be funny on its own, as well as what is heartbreakingly sad, frustrating, inspiring, pathetic, tragic, frightening and redemptive. It is by no means a “hit piece” or a prank or an attack on a man who does not always seem to make the best move. If we have done our jobs right, it will be a film that will electrify and move audiences, as well as something that our subject will be extremely proud of.</p>

        <section class="process">
            <h2>THE DOCUMENTARY PROCESS</h2>

            <p>Documentary filmmaking is fluid. There are questions to which we don’t yet have answers, and there are questions that will arise as we delve deeper into the narrative of Paul’s life — both in truth and in fiction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> In interviewing Paul, he’s admitted to the fabrication or embellishment of many events in Duplicity, which he’s repeatedly told us is 100% true.</li>
                <li> What is the extent of these embellishments? Why did he change what he did?</li>
                <li> We’ve uncovered documents suggesting that Paul was arrested for stalking Audrey. He leaves this out of his narrative. Is Paul willing to explain the circumstances surrounding this?</li>
                <li> Documents handed over to us by Paul suggest that he slandered Audrey by impersonating a prostitute and writing incriminating letters to her parents. Will Paul admit to this? How will he reconcile it with his “good guy” image he has constructed? </li>
                <li> How did Paul accrue 164,000 Twitter followers? Did he himself author Duplicity and The Chronicles, or did he hire a ghostwriter? Evidence on the internet suggests the latter. But does it matter?</li>
                <li> What does Paul hope to gain from all of this?</li>
                <li> Is Paul really driven by a desire to take down an international criminal conspiracy? Or “raise awareness” of sex trafficking?</li>
                <li> Can Paul explain why he continually finds himself in these situations — vulnerable to the exploitation of others?</li>
            </ul>
